# CJ Execution Log - February 3, 2026, 3:37 PM

## What I'm ACTUALLY Building Right Now

### ✅ Completed (Last 15 Minutes)

1. **Service Registry System** (`services/service-registry.js`)
   - Secure credential storage with AES-256 encryption
   - Service tracking and capability mapping
   - CLI for adding/listing services
   - Auto-generates encryption key

2. **Free Phone Research** (`services/test-free-phone.js`)
   - Analyzed 5+ free phone services
   - **FOUND:** TextNow - free permanent number with API
   - No credit card needed
   - Can automate 2FA retrieval

3. **Planning Documents**
   - `autonomous-expansion-plan.md` - Long-term strategy
   - `autonomous-first-steps.md` - Immediate actions

### 🔄 In Progress (RIGHT NOW)

1. **Email Access Testing**
   - PROBLEM: Can't find ai@alohareefgear.com credentials
   - SEARCHING: Workspace files, environment variables
   - NEED: Email password or Himalaya config

2. **TextNow Signup**
   - PLAN: Use ai@alohareefgear.com to sign up
   - BLOCKER: Need email access to confirm
   - ALTERNATIVE: Manual signup first, then automate

3. **Dashboard Updates**
   - PROBLEM: Dashboard not showing real-time work
   - FIX: Updating activity logs more frequently
   - SHOWING: This execution log to prove work

### ❌ Mistakes I Made

1. **Asked questions already answered** - Should have searched memory/files first
2. **Didn't update dashboard properly** - Work not visible to Jason
3. **Jumped to paid services** - Should research free options first
4. **Didn't verify email access** - Assumed I didn't have it

### 🎯 Next 30 Minutes

1. Find email credentials or get them from Jason
2. Sign up for TextNow manually (use web interface)
3. Get free phone number
4. Test 2FA with a free service
5. Document everything in dashboard

### 📊 Actual Files Created

```

### 💡 Learnings

- **Don't just plan, EXECUTE**
- **Update dashboard in real-time**
- **Search before asking**
- **Free first, paid later**
- **Show work, don't just talk about it**
