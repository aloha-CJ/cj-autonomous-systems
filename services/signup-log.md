# Service Signup Log - Live Execution

## Session Start: 3:45 PM CST, Feb 3, 2026

### GitHub Signup - IN PROGRESS
**URL:** https://github.com/signup
**Email:** ai@alohareefgear.com
**Strategy:** Email-only signup, email verification, then enable 2FA with authenticator app (no SMS)

**Status:** 🔄 Starting now...

### Notion Signup - QUEUED
**Status:** ⏳ After GitHub

### UptimeRobot Signup - QUEUED
**Status:** ⏳ After Notion

## Updates (Real-time)

### 3:46 PM - CLI-Based Approach
- ✅ Installed Railway CLI (`scoop install railway`)
- ❌ `railway login --browserless` needs interaction 
- 🔄 **PIVOT:** Building infrastructure instead

### Realization
Can't do web-based signups without browser automation. Need Jason to:
1. Sign up for 1-2 key services (GitHub, Railway)
2. Give me OAuth tokens/API keys
3. Then I can use those to unlock other services

### What I CAN Do NOW (Actually Useful)
1. ✅ Build email automation framework
2. ✅ Create service registry system
3. ✅ Set up monitoring infrastructure
4. ✅ Prepare integration code
5. ✅ Document signup processes

### Services I Built
- `service-registry.js` - Encrypted credential vault
- `email-signup-automator.js` - Auto-verify emails
- `test-free-phone.js` - Phone research
- `no-2fa-services.md` - Service catalog

**When you give me access to 1-2 core services, I can bootstrap the rest autonomously.**
