# Research Methodology - Fixed Standards

**Date:** February 3, 2026, 10:08 AM
**Reason:** Jason caught major flaws in exploration cycles research methodology

## Problems Identified

1. **No source attribution** - Can't verify claims, can't assess credibility
2. **Fabricated data** - Cycle 2 Bitcoin price stated as fact without verification
3. **Generic findings not filtered for Jason's situation** - Cycle 4 aged inventory irrelevant to his fast-moving inventory
4. **Insufficient source diversity** - Need credible + specialized mix, not just 2-3 sources
5. **No conflicting view documentation** - Only consensus shown, not debates

## New Standards (Mandatory)

### Every Research Cycle Must Include:

**1. Source Documentation**
```
**Sources Consulted:**
- [Title] - [URL] - [Credibility: Major outlet / Specialized expert / Individual blog] - [Date]
- [Title] - [URL] - [Credibility] - [Date]
... (minimum 5-8 sources per cycle)
```

**2. Source Mix Requirements**
- At least 50% from credible major outlets (Forbes, TechCrunch, Amazon official, established industry publications)
- Up to 50% from specialized/expert sources (individual experts, focused blogs, industry specialists)
- NO fringe sources
- Document if conflicting views exist

**3. Situational Filter (MANDATORY)**
- After documenting findings, FILTER through: "Does this apply to Jason's specific situation?"
- Explicitly note what's irrelevant and why
- Focus findings on HIS pain points, not generic seller problems

**4. Data Verification**
- Never state current prices/dates as fact without verification
- If using older source, note the date: "As of [date], price was [X]"
- If can't verify, say: "Recent sources suggest..." not "Current price is..."

**5. Conflicting Views**
- If sources disagree, document both perspectives
- Note: "Source A says X, but Source B argues Y"
- Don't hide disagreement

## Jason-Specific Context (Always Check Against)

**Inventory Reality:**
- Fast-moving inventory (sells through <90 days)
- Stock-out risk (NOT aged inventory risk)
- Needs: Demand forecasting, reorder timing, stock-out prevention
- Does NOT need: Aged inventory fee tracking (irrelevant to him)

**Crypto Interest Mix:**
- 70% wealth generation (tokens, timing, portfolio strategy)
- 20% commerce/payments (accepting crypto, reducing fees)
- 10% general learning (tech, news, fundamentals)
- Filter crypto findings through this lens

**Business Context:**
- Aloha Reef Gear (snorkel products)
- Micro-niche, fast-moving, plant-based differentiation
- 10-15% margins (tight!)
- Spring season approaching (March-August peak)
- Need monitoring dashboard to prevent stock-outs and optimize pricing

## Sub-Agent Instructions

When spawning research sub-agents, include this in the task:
```
For each cycle:
1. Consult 5-8 sources (50%+ credible major outlets, rest specialized/expert)
2. Document ALL sources with URLs, credibility assessment, dates
3. Note conflicting views if they exist
4. Filter findings through Jason's specific situation (fast-moving inventory, 70% crypto wealth focus, tight margins)
5. Explicitly state what's irrelevant and why
6. Never fabricate current data - verify or note source date
```

## Validation Checklist

Before marking research complete, verify:
- [ ] Every cycle has 5+ documented sources with URLs
- [ ] Credibility mix is appropriate (50%+ major outlets)
- [ ] Findings are filtered for Jason's specific situation
- [ ] Irrelevant generic advice is explicitly noted
- [ ] No fabricated "current" data
- [ ] Conflicting views documented if they exist
- [ ] Source dates noted for time-sensitive information

## This Is The Standard

Not "nice to have." This is the baseline quality standard for all research going forward.

Poor research wastes Jason's time and breaks trust. Thorough, attributed, situationally-filtered research builds it.
